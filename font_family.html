         A paragraph is a distinct section of writing, usually starting on a new line with an indent,
         that groups related sentences around a single central idea or topic, serving as a fundamental 
         building block for organizing longer texts like essays and articles for better readability and 
         structure. Typically, a paragraph includes a topic sentence, supporting sentences with details 
         or examples, and sometimes a concluding sentence that bridges to the next paragraph, helping
         readers follow the flow of thought.
