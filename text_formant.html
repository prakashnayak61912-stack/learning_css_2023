    <p class="t_indent">A paragraph is a distinct section of writing, a self-contained unit of discourse focusing on a single idea,
       made up of one or more sentences that develop a central point, typically starting on a new line and often signaled by an indentation.
       It helps organize text, making it easier for readers to follow ideas by grouping related sentences, usually with a topic sentence, 
       supporting details, and sometimes a concluding sentence, functioning as building blocks for longer works.
